"""Tri-model skill review (Phase 3).

Reuses the same review infrastructure that vets repo commits
(``_handle_multi_model_review`` in ``ouroboros.tools.review``) but:

- runs against one external skill package, not the staged diff of the
  self-modifying Ouroboros repo;
- uses the dedicated ``## Skill Review Checklist`` section in
  ``docs/CHECKLISTS.md`` instead of the Repo Commit Checklist;
- persists the verdict to the *skill* state plane
  (``data/state/skills/<name>/review.json``), not ``advisory_review.json``;
- never touches ``open_obligations`` or ``commit_readiness_debts`` — the
  two surfaces are deliberately siloed so a sticky skill finding cannot
  block repo commits and vice versa.

The module is pure logic: it does not register a tool. The public entry
point is ``review_skill``; the ``skill_review`` CLI tool (in
``ouroboros/tools/skill_exec.py``) wraps it.

You are performing a SKILL review, not a repo-commit review.

This review vets a single external skill package that lives OUTSIDE the
self-modifying Ouroboros repository. The skill cannot execute until it
produces a fresh review verdict (`clean`, `warnings`, or `blockers`) from
this review. Execution then depends on `skill_review_gate` and the current
review enforcement mode.

## Skill identity
- name: {skill_name}
- skill_dir: {skill_dir}
- content_hash: {content_hash}

## Manifest (parsed)
```json
{manifest_dump}
```

## Checklist (source of truth — follow it literally)

{checklist_section}

## Governance context — docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

Use Section 10 (Key Invariants), Section 12 (Host Service / Companion /
Chat IDs), and Section 13 (External Skills Layer)
as the binding description of what the skill is allowed to touch. In
particular invariant 11 is the authoritative rule: skills must not write
to the self-modifying repo, and reviewed execution is the primary gate.

{architecture_text}

## Governance context — docs/DEVELOPMENT.md

Use this as the engineering-standards baseline when judging
``timeout_and_output_discipline`` and when checking whether the skill's
code conforms to the module/function size expectations and the
no-silent-truncation rule for cognitive artifacts.

{development_text}

## Governance context — BIBLE.md

BIBLE.md is Ouroboros' constitutional core. Skills execute inside the
Ouroboros runtime, so a skill that violates a constitutional principle
(for example P0 bounded agency, or P9 version-history limits if the
skill manipulates release metadata) is grounds for FAIL even when the
Skill Review Checklist items permit the behaviour in isolation. Treat
BIBLE.md as the tie-breaker when a skill looks checklist-compliant but
contradicts the runtime's constitutional commitments.

{bible_text}

{skill_host_context}

## Skill files (every runtime-reachable file in skill_dir, text-only)

{file_pack}
{advisory_section}
{build_rebuttal_section(review_rebuttal)}
{review_history_section}

## Output contract

Return ONLY a JSON array that covers every checklist item at least once.
Expected items (in order): {items_json}

Each entry MUST have this shape:

{{"item": "<one of the items above>",
  "verdict": "PASS" | "FAIL",
  "severity": "critical" | "advisory",
  "reason": "<why, citing concrete files/lines inside the skill pack>"}}

Rules:

- Every expected item must appear at least once.
- If an item has no problems, return one PASS entry for that item.
- If an item has multiple distinct problems, return one FAIL entry per distinct
  root cause; do not hide additional bugs behind a single summary.
- Do not return a PASS for an item that also has a FAIL. A concrete FAIL wins.
- Do not repeat PASS entries for the same item.
- No prose before or after the JSON array.
- If the skill's ``type`` is not ``extension``, mark
  ``extension_namespace_discipline`` as PASS with reason
  "Not applicable — type != extension".
- Base every critical FAIL on a concrete file/line you can quote from
  the skill pack. Do not invent violations.
- For every FAIL, include a concrete proposed fix (file/symbol/change)
  so the skill author knows how to correct it.

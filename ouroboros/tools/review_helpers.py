## Critical severity threshold — READ BEFORE MARKING ANY FINDING CRITICAL

Before marking any finding CRITICAL you MUST:
1. Name the **exact file, symbol, function, test, or config path** in this repo
   that makes the problem live RIGHT NOW (not hypothetically in the future).
2. Confirm this artifact actually exists in the repo context you have been given.
3. If the concern depends on a hypothetical plugin, future integration, custom
   environment, fixture, or finalizer that does NOT appear in this repo's
   codebase — mark it **advisory**, not critical.
4. One root cause = one FAIL entry. Do NOT split one problem into multiple FAIL
   items that all require the same fix.
5. If a previous CRITICAL finding was concretely fixed and only a broader
   future-risk variant remains, mark that broader concern **advisory**.
   Do NOT hold an obligation open by reformulating a fixed concrete issue into
   a more abstract version.
6. Pre-existing gaps that exist entirely outside the touched area are advisory
   unless this diff directly depends on them or introduces a regression.
7. Narrative or descriptive mismatches are advisory unless they affect a real
   contract: release/version metadata, actual runtime behavior, safety guidance,
   or instructions a user/reviewer must rely on to use the changed feature correctly.
   Examples that should normally stay advisory: README test counts, descriptive
   "N fixes" summaries, or marketing-style numeric claims.

When in doubt: use "advisory". Reserve "critical" for clear, concrete,
repo-local, reachable defects.

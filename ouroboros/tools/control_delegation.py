"""Delegation-budget + in-task project-scoping affordances (v6.37.0).

Extracted from ``ouroboros/tools/control.py`` to keep that dispatcher module under
the module-size hard gate. These are the cyber-racing postmortem additions: the
typed child delegation-budget narrowing (C3.1) and the ``ensure_project_scope``
tool handler (C4.1). ``control.py`` imports both; ``_ensure_project_scope`` reaches
back into ``control._emit_control_event`` lazily (call-time) so there is no import
cycle.

"""Claude Code advisory pre-review gate.

Runs a read-only Claude Code review of the current worktree BEFORE the unified
multi-model pre-commit review. Advisory findings are non-blocking by themselves;
only the *absence* of a fresh matching advisory run blocks repo_commit.

Correct workflow:
  1. Finish ALL edits first
  2. advisory_pre_review(commit_message="...")   ← run AFTER all edits are done
  3. repo_commit(commit_message="...")           ← run IMMEDIATELY after advisory

⚠️ Any edit (repo_write / str_replace_editor) after step 2 automatically marks
   the advisory as stale — you must re-run advisory_pre_review before repo_commit.

Tool surface:
  advisory_pre_review   run a fresh advisory review
  review_status         show advisory history, open obligations, staleness state

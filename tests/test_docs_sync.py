"""Guardrails for architecture docs after UI/routing overhaul.

README prose pins were retired in v5.8.3-rc.5 — the README is intentionally
allowed to evolve its marketing copy without dragging tests along; the
ARCHITECTURE.md pins below are the load-bearing rationale-layer guards
(P6) that must survive every doc-touch commit.

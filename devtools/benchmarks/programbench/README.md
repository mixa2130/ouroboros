# ProgramBench

This adapter prepares Ouroboros workspace tasks for official ProgramBench
cleanroom execution.

Invariants:

- Use official `programbench` CLI for evaluation and summaries.
- Use `task_cleanroom` task images; do not score locally.
- Tool execution for the benchmark workspace runs in a no-network Docker
  backend.
- Reference binaries are declared through
  `resource_policy.protected_artifacts`: execute is allowed, byte reads,
  copy/hash/static introspection/tracing/debugging are denied.
- Submission artifact is `<run>/<instance_id>/submission.tar.gz`.
- `run_programbench.py` writes `run_manifest.json` and `result_index.jsonl`
  sidecars with cleanroom preflight, protected path, submission, and official
  eval command provenance. These files are audit artifacts; official
  `programbench eval/info` output remains the scoring source.
